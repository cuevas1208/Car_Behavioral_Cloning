# Project: Car Behavioral Cloning

Overview
---
This project, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks tools are used to clone driving behavior.
The model is trained, validated and tested using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the track in the simulator.

Dataset
---
The simulator will use the steering angles outs from the model to drive a car around a track.
The simulator has a setting to record data to train the model. The data set consists of image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.
